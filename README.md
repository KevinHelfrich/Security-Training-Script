# Security-Training-Script
Some people are bad at security, this script will help them learn.

In the last few decades computers have spread to all facets of life, unfortunately many people's understanding of computer security has not kept pace.
Help these people by installing this script on their system, perhaps when they leave their computer unlocked. I'm sure that in no time they will become security experts.

## Usage
Run install.bat in the same folder as main.ps1 and delayedRun.ps1, it will set up the lesson in security for the poor confused soul in question.

Run uninstall.bat when they have learned their lesson.

## What it does
A hidden folder is created on the victim's computer and a Powershell script (main.ps1) is copied there.

An hour after the install is run a script is set to run once a minute.

The script un-mutes the victims volume and sets it to one hundred per cent, it then says a useful security tip.
